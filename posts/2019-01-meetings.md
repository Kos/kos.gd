If you asked me a few years ago about my biggest issue at work, chances are I'd mention "too many meetings". A lot of things improved since then, but the theme seems to be popular, especially since useless meetings are known to occupy a large part of [the 4th circle of developer hell][hell].

Let's look at some reasons.

<!--more-->

Meetings weren't my favourite part of the workday. I intuitively graded workday quality based on how many meetings there were in the calendar. Scale: 0 = perfect productive day; full calendar = I'm going to brag if I even make it through.

I can think of several reasons why I had this attitude:

1. Meetings interrupt focus. They happen at a specific time by definition, and no matter what how focused and productive I felt at the time, I had to stop. Best case was when i had an alarm 10 minutes before to park my work properly!

2. Meetings take away from the time I'd otherwise spend on regular work. Rejecting a meeting is not cool in some environments, but the more I accepted, the less regular work I'd end up doing. This is a source of stress.

3. But most importantly, there's this phenomenon where after a meeting people walk out of the room thinking "we accomplished nothing" or "if I didn't come, it wouldn't matter and I'd so something productive instead".

I would like to frame Point 3 as "lack of clear purpose". Common symptoms: frustration and lack of attention during the meeting.

Here's what changed for me over the course of a few years: We solved point 3 and the rest suddenly stopped being an issue.

When I walk out of a meeting satisfied, I don't regret the time and I'm willing to pay the price of an interruption. In practice, I'd just put a little extra planning effort so that the interruption doesn't happen.

## Step one: know your own purpose

The first turning point I remember was a piece of advice from [Mel Lang][mel] who was kind enough to help my team out at the time:

> 1. know why you are there and what you want
> 2. if you're not getting what you want, make a request
> 3. if you don't know why you're there, find out or don't go

This checklist stuck with me for a long time. I started removing meetings from my calendar one way or another, and for the ones I kept, I began to develop a habit of _deciding what exactly I'd like to walk out with_ .

## Step two: role of the meeting driver

There are two general flavours of meetings:

- some look like a group of people talking about a topic,
- others would have a single person driving the discussion.

Either type can be efficient or not, but I noticed a small pattern: meetings with drivers I attended seemed to feel more consistently efficient. Let's explore this.

Meetings with a driver often have useful properties:

- There's a person (or a group) who has a particular objective (solve a problem, make a decision, design something)
- The objective is understood by all participants before they come
- The attendees arrive with the intention to help with achieving that objective
- When the objective is reached, the meeting is over
- The driver's best interest is to ensure the meeting stays on track
- The driver specifically picked the attendants based on expectations how they can help

If the above is in place, it's ensured that each participant has a strong sense of the meeting's purpose (and it's the same purpose so everyone). It's not likely that the meeting will cause frustration or feeling of wasted time.

## Why things can go sideways

### Weekly meetings

A calendar makes it easy to book time in advance. This is dangerous because it can easily lead to meetings happening because they're scheduled, not because there's a need. This causes curious situations where the goal of the meeting appears late:

> Welcome everyone to the weekly meeting of [group], what do we have for today?

Booking time in advance is not bad on its own, but it helps to establish the goal in advance anyway and cancel otherwise.

### Multiple meetings at once.

In one of the teams I worked, we had bi-weekly planning meetings which easily took half a day (sometimes more). I remember dreading them, feeling tired afterwards, and even writing off Mondays as "meeting days" where no productive work gets done. It took us a while to find a better format.

I attribute the chaos to the fact that each participant had a different goal for the meeting: Devs wanted to agree what goes next and write implementation plans, PO wanted estimates and commitment, devs wanted to review long term roadmap, PO wanted to check how realistic a new idea sounds, designers wanted to make sure we agree on UX and QA wanted to contest the spec and figure out a test plan.

If a meeting has say 8 people with 5 distinct goals total, there's only 20% time to address every single goal. This also worsens focus: Compare [YouTube party phenomenon][youtubeparty] (substitute discussing for movie-watching).

Different objectives call for different drivers and often different audience. I believe most large meetings could benefit from splitting: define clear sections, make a short break in between, or go all the way and schedule each section independently.

### Status (reporting) meetings

A meeting where each participant in turn reports the status of something (progress or success metrics) doesn't typically feel productive. This is surprising because it has a clear objective: ensure everyone is informed. However, it's not given that every participant actually _wants_ to be informed in this specific way. There are more ways to do a status report and many of them don't require everyone to be physically present at the exact same time.

## Summary

My observation is that presence of a well-defined meeting objective has strong correlation with whether I walk out of the meeting with the feeling of accomplishment. However obvious that sounds, there's a surprising amount of potential reasons why the objective can end up diluted.
