## Drift (1994)

I only played this game a few dozen times, but I'm listing it first here because it has easily been the most impactful for me. It somehow become one of my core memories: I had very vivid recollection of playing it, all because its unique aspect of random level generation. See, every time you advance to a new level in Drift, there's some random chance of this level being some kind of special level, like "aliens only" or "wormholes only" or a few more... I need to compile a whole list. Later in my life I played a lot of Angband, the classic roguelike, and Angband had the same theme: you could randomly stumble upon a cavernous level, or a level with a vault or a pit full of orcs... So my memory happily combined the two concepts and reframed Drift as a "Roguelike version of Asteroids". I don't know if that's true, but truth is I spent at least 10 years (on and off), trying to find its name. I only remembered that it had vector graphics, a short maybe 5-letter name, and early-Windows user interface. Not much to work with, until I finally found a mention of it on [Moby Games][moby], and found the game itself on a magazine CD on the Web Archive.

Anyway, if you were wondering why the individual levels in Beat Rocks have titles, this is exactly why: I took it straight from Drift.

If you'd like to play it today, you'll need some early Windows version. I used the 86box emulator and Windows 98 SE.

## "Gravitar" (1990)

Just like in case of Drift, I found Gravitar in the freeware section of a cover CD and played it a good amount. It took me many years to realize that Gravitar is actually an Atari classic, and that the version I played looks like a freeware remake, not affiliated with Atari.

The version I played was really smooth, if you the awkward controls. Instead of asteroids we're attacking planetary bases. There's multiple "zoom levels" to the game: the "star map" hub-world where we pick a level, and the actual surface. The DOS edition also zooms in to a 

As of writing this I still haven't played the original Gravitar, but I'm on the lookout whenever visiting an arcade! Maybe I should say hi to the folks behind the [Warsaw Pinball museum][pinballstation], who knows, perhaps I'll be lucky...
