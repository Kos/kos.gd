## Drift (1994)

I only played this game a few dozen times, but I'm listing it first here because it has easily been the most impactful for me. It somehow become one of my core memories: I had very vivid recollection of playing it, all because its unique aspect of random level generation. See, every time you advance to a new level in Drift, there's some random chance of this level being some kind of special level, like "aliens only" or "wormholes only" or a few more... I need to compile a whole list. Later in my life I played a lot of Angband, the classic roguelike, and Angband had the same theme: you could randomly stumble upon a cavernous level, or a level with a vault or a pit full of orcs... So my memory happily combined the two concepts and reframed Drift as a "Roguelike version of Asteroids". I don't know if that's true, but truth is I spent at least 10 years (on and off), trying to find its name. I only remembered that it had vector graphics, a short maybe 5-letter name, and early-Windows user interface. Not much to work with, until I finally found a mention of it on [Moby Games][moby], and found the game itself on a magazine CD on the Web Archive.

Anyway, if you were wondering why the individual levels in Beat Rocks have titles, this is exactly why: I took it straight from Drift.

If you'd like to play it today, you'll need some early Windows version. I used the 86box emulator and Windows 98 SE.

## "Gravitar" (1990)

Just like in case of Drift, I found Gravitar in the freeware section of a cover CD and played it a good amount. It took me many years to realize that Gravitar is actually an Atari classic, and that the version I played looks like a fan-made remake, not at all affiliated with Atari. It plays smoothly, if you ignore the awkward controls.

The whole theme of Gravitar is that instead of asteroids we're now attacking planetary bases! The planets have gravity, so controlling the ship is a bigger challenge. Some levels are larger than the screen, and there's a scrolling viewport! Additionally, there's a "hub" level where you choose the next location to go. This lets you choose your own difficulty to some degree.

Playing Gravitar convinced me further that the "asteroidslike" genre is pretty open-ended and can easily adapt a more extensive game design with multiple unique locations.

As of writing this I still haven't played the original arcade version of Gravitar, but I'm on the lookout whenever visiting an arcade! Maybe I should say hi to the folks behind the [Warsaw Pinball museum][pinballstation], who knows, perhaps I'll be lucky...

I tried the recent [remaster][gravitar-rem] but it didn't vibe with me very much. Recently I spent quite long with [Gravity Ace][ace] - not a remake but conceptually close, I recomend you give it a try! It's extremely polished and you can feel the author's love for the genre.

If you want to try the DOS version of Gravitar that I played, it's available on [dos.zone][grav]. For the arcade version, I suppose you could look for a retro gaming venue... :-)

## Comet Busters! (1994)

Unlike the previous two titles, CB! is a shareware game. It clearly shows when you look at how polished it is: the physics is _just right_, the level progression feels well-balanced and the sound effects fit perfectly. The game didn't really bend the genre in any new way, but it had a perfectly workable multiplayer (up to 4 players, co-op or PVP depending on your settings).

## Mine Storm (1982)

Not to be confused with [the other Minefield][mine], this game is the launch title of the [Vectrex][vectrex] console and I got to play it a few times on various gaming events.

It's a pretty solid and playable rendition of Asteroids, but the main reason I found it impactful is how amazing it looks and feels when played on the original console (if you get used to the awkward controller, that is).

See, the Vectrex uses a cathode ray tube display (in portrait). Unlike your usual CRT screen, however, the display doesn't do pixels or scanlines: it draws all the shapes _exactly_ on the screen, not unlike an oscilloscope. It has effectively infinite "resolution" because all the shapes are geometrically accurate. Together with the game's smooth animation, it looks uncanny and deserves to be seen live.

I encourage you to play Minefield in the [Warsaw Museum of Computers and Games][wmkig] next time you're around.
